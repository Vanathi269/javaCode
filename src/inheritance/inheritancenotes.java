/*
 * oops;
 * object oriented programming
 * it contains some principles
 * any language following these principles is called as oops language
 * 
 * 1.classes
 * 2.objects
 * 
 * core pillars
 * 1.inheritance
 * 		used to achieve code reusability
 * 		remove all the duplicate from the all child class and move it to the parent class
 * 		define the relation between parent and child class using extends keyword
 * 		object class is the parent of all the classes (with no parent) in java
 *		parent class is also called as super class
 * 		child class is also called as sub class
 * 2.polymorphism
 * poly:many
 * morphism:form
 * 
 * two types of polymorphism 
 * 1.compile time (static) method overloading
 * 		--the {} inside the method--method implementation
 * 		--we have same method but with the different signature
 * 		--can be achieved by having different no. of parameters
 * 		--can be achieved by changing the data types
 * 		
 * 2.run time (dynamic) it is also called AS method overriding
 * 		--compile class can have the same method as defined in the parent class with different implementation
 * 		--if the method is present in the child class, execute the method
 * 		--if the method is not present in the child class, go to parent class and search the method 
 * 
 *--overriding occurs when the child class and the parent class has the same method 
 * 

 * 3.encapsulation
 * 4.abstraction
 * 
 * 
 * additional concepts:(relationship between two object, not parent and child class)
 * 
 * association:
 * relationship between two objects:
 * 
 * 
 * 1.composition:"belongs-to" or" has -a"
 * school has a department
 * school has classroom
 * a car has wheels
 * tightly coupled
 * strong association
 * human has heart
 *   
 * 2.Aggregation relationship:has -a
 * school has teacher --independently teacher can work
 * lightly coupled
 * week association
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * school management system
 * 
 * schoolbase-moveall tha common method to the parentclass
 * lunchbreak();
 * doexercise();
 * markAttendance()
 * 
 * students
 * attend sessions()
 * appearExam()
 * submitreport()
 * projectcasestudy()
 * 
 * 
 * teacher
 * 
 * conductsession()
 * assessment()
 * 
 * staff
 * feesreport()
  * timingreport()
