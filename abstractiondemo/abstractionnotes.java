 * abstract
 * is an idea of some feature
 * but how to do that is not clear
 * 
 * Abstract method
 * any method without an implementation is called as an abstract method
 * 
 * with abstraction
 * we are trying to hide the code
 * 1.Abstract class
 * 		--regular like a normal class but with an abstract keyword
 * 		--it can contain both regular methods as well as abstract method
 * 		--to create a method without a body we use abstract keyword
 * 		--over 0 to 100% abstraction can be achieved ideally it,s 100% abstraction it shoul be interface
 * 		
 * 2.interfaces
 * 		--is a mechanism through which we define the feature only
 * 		--but not the code
 * 		--it is responsibility of the classes implement of all the method
 * 		--using interfaces, we can achieve multiple inheritance
 * 		--by default ,all the methods are abstract in nature
 * 		--100% abstraction is achieved
